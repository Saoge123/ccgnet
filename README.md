# ccgnet
CCGNet (Co-Crystal Graph Network) is a deep learning framework for virtual screening of binary organic cocrystals, which integrates the priori knowledge into the feature learning on molecular graph and achieves a great improvement of performance for data-driven cocrystal screening.

Requirements:
* Python 3.7
* Tensorflow (1.6=<Version<2.0)
* RDKit
* Openbabel 2.4.1
* CCDC Python API
* Scikit-learn

The ccgnet module could be used to build CCGNet models. In ccgnet, the message passing is implement by Graph-CNN, where the code of this part we borrow from https://github.com/fps7806/Graph-CNN. The Featurize module represents the combination of two molecules as the input of CCGNet models.
# usage
We integrated the ensemble model as pipeline that can provide the high throughput screening for the defined compounds pairs and generate a report form automatically. 
predict.py can run the ensemble model that were composed by trained 10 models, whose mean balanced accuracy achieve 98.60% in 10-fold cross validation.
~~~
python predict.py -h
optional arguments:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  -table TABLE         The table of coformer pairs
  -mol_dir MOL_DIR     path of molecular file, default is "./"
  -out OUT             name of predictive file, default is "Result.xlsx"
  -fmt {sdf,mol,mol2}  format of molecular fileï¼Œwhich support sdf, mol, mol2.
                       default is sdf
  -type {ecc,cc}       common cocrystal "cc" or energetic cocrusyal "ecc",
                       default is "cc"
~~~
First, you need to prepare the structure files of each coformer, whose format can be 'sdf', 'mol', 'mol2'.
Then, a table that reprensents the pairs of coformers should be generated. Each item in line is separated by "\t". like this:
